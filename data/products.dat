Mike then signed to Outkast's Aquemini label, which was distributed by Columbia Records, and in 2003 released his debut album, "Monster" which went Gold|

023|The Chronic|Dr. Dre|Rap|10.00| |1989's Straight Outta Compton, by Dre's previous outfit N.W.A., may have shined the public spotlight on the genre, butThe Chroniclegitimized it. That is not to say thatSnoop Doggy Dogg(The Chronicmarks his debut) and Dre's raps are for everyone; the subject matter is the sex, drugs, violence, and politics of South Central Los Angeles, and the phrasing is explicit, to say the least. ButThe Chronic's real genius is the music. By breeding hip-hop, jazz (studio instrumentation includes saxophones and flutes), funk, and soul (sampled artists includeParliament,Donny Hathaway, andIsaac Hayes), Dre creates downright intoxicating grooves. If you can't feelThe Chronic pulsating through your veins, maybe your heart's not pumping.|
024|G I R L|Pharrell Williams|Rap|11.88| |Redefining cool for a new generation, Pharrell Williams is a creative force, using music, fashion, and design to express his distinctive style. From his beginnings as a teenage prodigy and multi-instrumentalist in Virginia Beach back in the early '90s, through enough hits to earn him Billboard's Producer of the Decade in 2010, to his current status as multi-media superstar, Williams has never stopped creating. Starting his producing career as one half of The Neptunes with Chad Hugo, Williams has helped create such classics as Daft Punk's "Get Lucky," Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," Nelly's "Hot in Herre," Jay-Z's "I Just Wanna Love U (Give it 2 Me)," Britney Spears's "I'm A Slave 4 U," and Justin Timberlake's "Like I Love You."G I R L is Pharrell's highly anticipated new album, and features the hit single, "Happy", an international phenomenon and radio smash. "Happy" was first featured on Despicable Me 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). It is nominated for an OSCAR this year for Best Original Song, and Pharrell will perform "Happy" on the OSCARs on March 2nd, on ABC.|
025|2Pac Greatest Hits|2Pac|Rap|17.88| |An indispensable and definitive collection showcasing the passionate genius of the late rapper. The album's nonchronological sequence highlights the contradictory impulses that made Tupac's music so commanding; the 21 well-loved "hits," some slightly reedited for legal reasons, are accompanied by four previously unheard songs. Of the new material, the raw-sounding "God Bless the Dead" has been the subject of the most speculation, owing to its subject matter: a eulogizing of the lateNotorious B.I.G.--a mysterious feat, since Tupac was killed six months before Biggie. And, making its first proper appearance on a Tupac album, the B-side "Hit 'Em Up" stands as the most intense outburst of pure venomous rage ever captured on tape. Whether he's waxing political, philosophical, or just plain paranoid, Tupac's empathetic, charismatic style remains unmatched.|
026|Life After Death|Notorious B.I.G.|Rap|10.00| |The King of Brooklyn, Biggie Smalls, busted through with an instant hip-hop classic on his first album,Ready to Die, but he outdid even his standard onLife After Death, an audible, posthumous autobiography about the life of the former dope dealer. The 2 CD set revels in death, especially on "Niggaz Bleed," "Somebody's Gotta Die," and "You're Nobody ('Til Somebody Kills You)," but it's painfully clear that this chestnut-cheeked, fun-loving father of two wanted to see his kids grow up on "Sky Is the Limit" and "Miss U," both of which point to the future. The album also serves as a testament to Biggie's flexibility: he adopts Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's rapid rhyme flow and Midwestern beats when they guest on "Notorious Thugs," he positively bounces on both "Mo Money Mo Problems" and "Going Back to Cali" (guesting Eazy Mo Bee), and even kicks it Wu-Tang style when RZA shows up for "Long Kiss Goodnight."|
027|Boss Life|Slim Thug|Rap|12.66| |When Slim Thug decided to name his major label debut, Already Platinum, the Houston, Texas-based rapper wasn't suffering from a bout of wishful thinking. On the contrary, he was stating a fact: a bold proclamation that even though he was anonymous to most people outside the state of Texas, he had already sold enough records in his home state to be certified a veritable rap star. Now the rest of the country will be able to hear what's made Slim Thug Already Platinum.|
028|Blood, Sweat & Tears|Ace Hood|Rap|12.58| |Ace Hood gets personal on Trials & Tribulations, his fourth full-length album and first for We The Best Music/Cash Money Records. It's more than just a collection of songs for the gold-selling Florida MC. In fact, it tells his story.|
029|The Barrel Brothers|Skyzoo & Torae|Rap|10.99| |The idea behind Barrel Brothers is what the people have asked and come to know the two wordsmiths for; pure lyricism. Skyzoo, known for his picturesque storytelling and jazz/orchestrial background, and Torae, known for his gritty Coney Island depictions of life with a vintage but modern lyrical approach, have briefly put their normal forte s to the side and crafted this album with one game plan in mind; lyrical exercise over hard New York City soundscapes. The current resurgence of NYC hip-hop is perfect grounds for two of its premier flag holders to continue doing what they never stopped doing in the first place; representing the city.|
030|The Marshall Mathers LP 2|Eminem|Rap|6.96| |2010 release from the Hip Hop superstar, the long-awaited follow-up to his Relapse album. Features production from Just Blaze, Jim Jonsin and Mobb Deep's Havoc plus guest appearances from Lil Wayne, Pink and Rihanna. "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year," remarked Eminem. "But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title".|
